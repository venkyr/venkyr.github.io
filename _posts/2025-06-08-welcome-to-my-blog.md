This is my first blog post! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences with you. In this blog, I'll be writing about various topics that interest me, including:

- Technology trends
- Personal experiences
- Tutorials and guides
- Thoughts and ideas

The blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).  I used "vibe coding" with [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) to setup Jekyll on Github Pages as I was not familiar with either.  Cursor is an AI-assisted Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
